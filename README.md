Please note: Big general parts e.g. random() of the basil.js source code are copy & paste
of the fantasic [processing.js](http://processingjs.org) project created by John Resig. We would have had a hard time
to figure all of that out on our own!

Supported Adobe Indesign versions: CS 5, CS 5.5 and CS 6
